Piper Jane and Charlotte Ventured out on this beautiful day to the Line It Up Horse Show. Piper rode the ever steady Leroy Brown and Charlotte pulled up her big girl boots and rode Wally at his very 1st horse show. Everyone did amazing!! Wally held up his end of the bargain and was a perfect gentleman. We could not have asked for more. A special thanks to Emily Bibb for taking Piper in the leadline class so that I could stay with Wally for his 1st show. You did an awesome job and you even ran in the trot class. Wahoo!!
